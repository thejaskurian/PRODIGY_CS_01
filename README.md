# PRODIGY_CS_01
Create a Python program that encrypts and decrypts text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. The program should allow users to input a message and a shift value to perform the encryption and decryption.

#Caesar Cipher
This project implements a straightforward Caesar Cipher algorithm in Python. The Caesar Cipher is a fundamental encryption method in which each letter in a text is shifted by a set number of positions in the alphabet.

##Features
Encryption: Shifts each letter in the input text by a specified number of positions.
## Features
#### Encryption: 
  Shifts each letter in the input text by a specified number of positions.
  For example, if you input "abc" with a shift value of 4, "a" will become "e", "b" will become "f", and "c" will become "g". Thus, the final output will be "efg". Each letter in the original text is shifted by 4 positions in the alphabet.

#### Decryption: 
Reverses the shift to retrieve the original text.
##Usage
For example, if you input "efg" with a shift value of 4, "e" will be shifted back by 4 positions to become "a", resulting in the output "abc".

## Usage
Running the Program: Execute the Python script and follow the prompts.
User Input:
Choose to encrypt or decrypt.
Enter the message.
User Input:
1. Choose to encrypt or decrypt.
2. Enter the message.
3. Enter the shift value.
